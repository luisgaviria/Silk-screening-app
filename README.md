## Hi! This app is called Apps Silk Printing.

       
*It's an app designed to be a silk screening business.*

          
*It is built with Node, Express and React. It also uses the SanMar API Integration
to get the products that are displayed on the catalog.*

*Libraries used: axios, mongoose, mongodb, node-cron, passport, sendgrid, stripe, neat-csv, csv-parser, react-bootstrap.*

*A user can navigate to the site https://apps-silk-screening.herokuapp.com/ to find out what services the business provides. 
A Users can browse through the products catalog to choose an item they would like to get work done on.
A user can submit a Request A Quote form which will be emailed to the business owner using SenGrid.*


*To run this project you will need to create a dev.js file and add your own keys matching the prod.js file.  You will also need to create an account with SanMar integration and get a SanMar FTP password to access the SanMar files via FTP server.  After this you can navigate to the server directory and run the command npm run dev and access the port at localhost:3000


*Moving forward I will be working on the overall styling of the app,  adding pagination and incorporating a second catalog.**
